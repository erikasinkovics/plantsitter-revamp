# Welcome!
This is an overhaul of the **PlantSitter** rails prototype built with my project team during the AirBnB at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) coding bootcamp. The original project can be found at [this link](http://plantsitter.herokuapp.com/).

------- 

## Objectives
Being a 4.5 day project, our main focus was building the MVP, namely enabling _customers_ to _book plantsitters_ for the date of their choice and manage (accept/reject) their bookings. As a result of that, there is still some potential in implementing some additional features.

### Improvements
* Improve the quality of the code, create a cleaner codebase with comments if needed
* Responsivity - the original prototype is optimized to be used on a mobile screen, my goal is to provide a solid user experience on larger screens as well
* Rethink the UI design, give the app a more minimalistic, and fresh look 
* Authorization with Pundit

### New features
There are a couple of additional features that would contribute to better usability.
* Visualizing available plantsitters on a map, providing a map with the customers address to plantsitters in the booking details
* Reviews
* Live chat between users
